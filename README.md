# Typing Practice Game

A fun, simple game for becoming a better typer, expanding your vocab by learning new words, or learning a language. A desktop app I built as part of a free-choice project in 7th grade, using Python's Tkinter GUI toolkit.

## Built-in languages
• English
• Estonian

## Features
• Curate your game: choose prompt length to blitz through words like 'clue' and 'lock', or challenge yourself in spelling out 'extraterrestrial'
• WPM scores saved locally; gauge your progress over time

## Instructions
• Launch via `main.py`
• To reset the leaderboard, run `clear-scores.bat`
