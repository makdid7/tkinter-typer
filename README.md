# Tkinter Typer

A fun, simple game for becoming a better typer, expanding your vocab by learning new words, or learning a language. A desktop app I built as part of a free-choice 'Creative Project' in 7th grade, using Python's Tkinter GUI toolkit.

## Features
• Curate your experience: choose prompt length to blitz through words like 'clue' and 'lock', or challenge yourself by spelling out 'extraterrestrial'

• WPM scores saved locally; gauge your progress over time

## Built-in languages

• Estonian

## Instructions
• Launch via `main.py` (or use a safe `.py` to `.exe` conversion tool)

• To reset the leaderboard, run `clear-scores.bat`
